# Conway's Game of Life v0.7 - Draw Creatures

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway. This project allows users to draw their own creatures and then simulate their evolution based on the classic rules of the Game of Life.

## Features
- **Draw Creatures**: Users can manually create initial patterns by drawing cells on the grid.
- **Simulation**: Watch your creatures evolve as the simulation follows the four simple rules of Conway's Game of Life.
- **Interactive Demo**: A fully interactive demo to experiment with different configurations and see how they evolve.

## How it works
1. **Draw your creatures**: Click on the grid to activate cells and form patterns.
2. **Hit Play**: The simulation will run according to the following rules:
   - Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
   - Any dead cell with exactly three neighbors becomes a live cell.
   - All other live cells die in the next generation, and all other dead cells stay dead.
